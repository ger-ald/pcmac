PCMAC is a two pass, symbolic cross assembler for the PC\XT\AT\PS2 computers. This assembler is a special one, because it is not dedicated to any processor. The user of PCMAC can decide what kind of assembly language to use, and what kind of code he wants to be generated. Therefore a very special macro language is supported in PCMAC that is powerful enough to define any assembly language like Z80 or MC68000. (Definition of a few cpu's with the z80 among them are included as samples.) The assembler supports many possibilities to maintain big assembly programs.

Some of the features:
* Special string and character expressions.
* Full C language like expressions.
* Powerful primitive commands to build up higher level assembly instruction.
* Directive and command line option driven listing.
* Symbol table listing.
* Fully compiled binary or linkable object code output chosen by the user.

The fact that you can also define your own cpu definition makes PCMAC ideal for homebuilt processors.

PCMAC was written aeons ago, and was released as shareware.
As it did not generate any revenue, it was formed to freeware as an XT compiled code.
Now it becomes 100% free ware, covered by the 'Apache V2.0' license. <sup>(I have written permission from the owner)</sup>
